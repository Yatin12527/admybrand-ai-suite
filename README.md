## üìÇ Project Structure

The codebase is organized logically, with a focus on reusability and maintainability.

```
/src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /app
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /components
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /animated  // folder for subcomponents 
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /ui        // Reusable UI components (Hero, Pricing, FAQ, etc.)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css    // Global styles
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx     // Root layout
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx       // The main page entry point
```

The core logic is centered in `page.tsx`, which composes the page by assembling the various UI components from the `/components/ui` directory. This structure makes it easy to manage and update individual sections of the landing page.
